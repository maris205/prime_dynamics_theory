# RH Research Handoff

Status date: 2026-08-04

Current completed endpoint: RH-361

Completed research batch: RH-352 through RH-361

Research batch publication commit:
`91167fe163831d3360b4c4007ed600865610e9ec`

The repository, not an old chat transcript, is the source of truth.

## 1. Continuation protocol

Work in `/root/math/prime_dynamics_theory`. Before any state-changing RH
paper, run:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git pull --rebase origin main
```

Read completely:

RH-361 does not automatically activate RH-362. Start with a read-only source
lock. Create a new number only for an actual bridge, a typed `q/E_off`
theorem, a rigorous physical obstruction, or another independent theorem
edge. An abstract fiber, finite fit, deterministic reparameterization, or
inactive criterion is not a reopening input.

Follow the multi-agent workflow in `AGENTS.md`: the primary alone chooses the
route, edits this handoff, integrates, stages, commits, rebases, and pushes.
Use subagents for source lock, adversarial proof audit, one exclusive writer,
and release QA. Preserve all unrelated caches, checkpoints, LaTeX
intermediates, and TPC work. Stage only the active RH files. Pull with rebase
before every commit and again before every push.

## 2. Program objective and claim boundary

The project develops a conditional prime-dynamics route inspired by the
Hilbert--Polya program. It is not a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.

- Gate A: canonical intrinsic dynamical spectral determinant.
- Gate B: time-oriented scattering or unitary completion.
- Gate C: genuine self-adjoint generator and intrinsic `T log T` law.
- Gate D: von Mangoldt-weighted prime-power traces.
- Gate E: equality with the completed-zeta divisor.

All five Gates are false/open. No batch paper constructs a Hilbert--Polya
operator, identifies Riemann zeros, proves a von Mangoldt trace, proves
completed-zeta divisor equality, or implies RH.

The batch has two typed branches and no cross-branch bridge:

```text
actual direct branch      = RH-352--RH-354, actual p/Y,
                             but selected or normalized
deterministic counterloop = RH-355--RH-360, unconditional only for s
cross-branch bridge       = absent
```

On one common Hardy clock:

```text
p = tau-a = q-d
d = h-s
q = p+d
h = s+d
```

`p` is the actual direct coefficient, `q` the full-trace coefficient, `h`
the actual modulus-complete Hardy head, and `s` the deterministic graded
counterloop. RH-354's normalized actual `p` tail is neither an unnormalized
complete prefix nor a `q/E_off` theorem. Deterministic `s` is not an actual
head, root set, rank law, or spectral submultiset.

The deterministic target side remains exact and all-order: RH-263 gives the
deterministic numerator coefficient anchor, and RH-267--RH-268 give the
deterministic all-order envelope and sharp target radius. These results do
not close the RH-241 moving noisy all-order envelope or coefficient bridge.
RH-288 remains inactive because the complete same-type physical prefix leaf
is absent.

## 3. Decision after RH-361

Current route coordinate:

```text
actual_same_clock_unnormalized_head_transport_open
```

The first physical blocker is

```text
D_(4k)(R)
 = sum_(2<=n<4k) |h_(sigma,n)-s_(k,n)| R^n/n
 -> 0.
```

All RH-355--RH-360 actual-head inheritance statements assume this
unnormalized, same-clock leaf; none proves it. Normalized upper-band matching
or coordinatewise relative matching does not imply it.

RH-361 proves a finite coefficient-information-class theorem. On a fixed
nonempty finite order set `I`, for positive weights and fixed signed arrays
`p,s`, every signed array `e` gives

```text
d[e] = e
q[e] = p+e
h[e] = s+e.
```

The identities hold exactly. Along `e=t v`, `v!=0`, the weighted norms of
`q[e]` and `h[e]` have no finite uniform upper bound determined by `p,s`.
The choices `e=-p` and `e=-s` give `q=0` and `h=0`, respectively, so each
norm has infimum zero. This does not say the same fiber makes both zero, that
arbitrary defects are physically realizable, or that two noisy operators
have been constructed. `E_off`, roots, ranks, multisets, and determinants
still require separate realization/identification theorems.

The deterministic terminal-lag route is closed only at its declared budget
type: geometric localization (RH-358), logarithmic inverse accuracy
(RH-359), and the exponential-transform phase diagram (RH-360). Actual
transfer remains conditional on `D_(4k)(R)->0`.

## 4. Compact conclusions from RH-352 through RH-361

- **RH-352:** Actual growing lower-even normalized `p` is exponentially
  small and actual `Y` tracks `S-P` on `J_k->infinity`, `J_k=o(k)`; the
  selected `Y` aggregate has the proved positive lower-scale obstruction,
  but no unnormalized prefix theorem follows.
- **RH-353:** Actual critical/first-lower normalized `Y` has the phase-free
  two-coordinate gap (with the recorded `>1/9` lower bound); it is not a
  direct-`p` lower bound.
- **RH-354:** Actual parity-free direct `p` has a normalized tail theorem
  above a moving cut; low orders, the unnormalized prefix, and `q/E_off`
  remain open.
- **RH-355:** Complete deterministic strict-upper burden and terminal share;
  actual transfer is conditional on `D_(4k)(R)->0`.
- **RH-356:** Deterministic mesoscopic crossover and integer phase; actual
  transfer remains conditional.
- **RH-357:** Complete deterministic linear-depth endpoint profile and floor
  phases; actual transfer remains conditional.
- **RH-358:** Deterministic terminal-lag geometric TV localization and first
  two moments; not an eigenvalue or root-counting law.
- **RH-359:** Deterministic logarithmic accuracy, inverse-window law, and
  correction limit set `[0,1]`; actual transfer remains conditional.
- **RH-360:** Deterministic subcritical, critical-window, and supercritical
  exponential-tilt phase diagram at the declared budget type.
- **RH-361:** Exact typed separation and finite-fiber nonpromotion theorem;
  no physical counterexample or spectral conclusion is constructed.

## 5. Route firewall and reopening triggers

Do not:

- call the RH-361 coefficient fiber a physical counterexample;
- promote normalized actual `p` to unnormalized `q/E_off`;
- promote deterministic `s` to an actual spectrum, root set, or rank law;
- state a conditional `D_(4k)(R)` transfer as proved;
- identify a selected window with the full prefix or `E_off`;
- use finite rows as physical or asymptotic evidence; or
- extend the deterministic terminal-lag sequence by reparameterization alone.

Admissible RH-362 triggers are:

1. An actual same-clock `D_(4k)(R)->0` theorem, or a genuine physical
   obstruction to it.
2. A typed actual full-trace `q` or complete `E_off` theorem.
3. An unnormalized complete direct-prefix theorem, including orders below
   the RH-354 moving cut.
4. The RH-241 moving noisy all-order envelope plus its no-over-extraction
   coefficient bridge.
5. Another independent source-backed theorem edge.

Even `D_(4k)(R)->0` would transfer only named moment/budget laws. Root, rank,
spectral-submultiset, and canonical determinant identification remain
separate. RH-288 activates only after the complete direct prefix and both
analytic tails close in one physical determinant data type.

## 6. Default RH-362 investigation

RH-362 is read-only until a theorem edge is found. Freeze:

```text
h_(sigma,n)       = actual modulus-complete Hardy-head moment
s_(k,n)           = deterministic graded counterloop moment
d_(sigma,k,n)     = h_(sigma,n)-s_(k,n)
2 <= n < 4k
```

Search for a cross-order identity, conservation law, contour/Fourier
formula, operator estimate, or other source-backed restriction on the actual
defect. Keep the unnormalized `D_(4k)`, RH-355 normalized `Delta_k^up`, and
coordinatewise relative matching distinct. Audit clock, order range,
uniformity, signs, data type, and loss ledger. If no actual theorem, rigorous
physical obstruction, or independent theorem edge exists, return
`NOT_TESTABLE` and do not create RH-362.

The 2026-08-04 RH-362 source lock returned `NOT_TESTABLE` at repository
`HEAD=9902699`: RH-342 fixes the actual-head and deterministic-shell types,
RH-355 fixes the exact unnormalized `D_(4k)(R)` leaf, and RH-303 supplies only
a fixed-order consequence of an already-open annular hypothesis. RH-287 and
RH-294 use slower or unspecified diagonal clocks without head transport.
RH-352--RH-354 remain selected/normalized actual results, while RH-340,
RH-342, RH-343, and RH-355 provide only information-class or absolute-
majorant negatives, explicitly not physical `D` behavior. No source pays the
common-clock all-order defect budget, and no physical obstruction or
independent admissible theorem edge was found. Retain the route coordinate
`actual_same_clock_unnormalized_head_transport_open` and do not create RH-362.
An independent adversarial proof audit reached the same `NOT_TESTABLE`
verdict: normalized-to-unnormalized promotion, selected-window-to-full-prefix
promotion, and absolute-majorant-to-signed-obstruction promotion all fail
without a new actual theorem.

The parallel alternative-route scan also found no reopening edge. RH-241's
`all_order_trace_envelope` and `coefficient_anchor` flags remain false; RH-300
has only an inactive annular `H^\infty/H^2` criterion. RH-287 and RH-294 use
rate-free or arbitrarily slow diagonal clocks and do not prove physical-head
transport. RH-334/RH-339/RH-344/RH-346/RH-348 supply exact typed `q` identities
only; they do not bound the aggregate `E_off` or the defect `d`. Thus the
typed `q/E_off` route is also `NOT_TESTABLE`, and the route coordinate remains
`actual_same_clock_unnormalized_head_transport_open`.

## 8. Continuation prompt

```text
Continue RH research in /root/math/prime_dynamics_theory. Treat the
repository as the sole source of truth. Read AGENTS.md, RH_HANDOFF.md, and
the RH-361 README, UPDATED_ROADMAP, THEOREM_LEDGER, result.json, and main.pdf
completely. Run git status --short --branch and git pull --rebase origin main
before any state change. Begin with a read-only source lock on the actual
same-clock defect d=h-s and the unnormalized D_(4k)(R) obligation.

RH-362 is not activated by RH-361 alone. Create it only for an actual bridge,
a typed q/E_off theorem, a rigorous physical obstruction, or another
independent theorem edge. Do not treat the RH-361 coefficient fiber as a
physical counterexample. Do not identify deterministic counterloop moments
with actual spectral data. Keep Gates A--E false/open until their exact
definitions are proved.
```
